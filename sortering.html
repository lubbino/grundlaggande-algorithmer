            // Reflection:
            // Bubble sort works well for small lists, like in this case with only 5 numbers.
            // It is easy to understand and implement, which makes it good for beginners or educational purposes.
            // The algorithm compares each element with the next and swaps if needed, repeating until the list is sorted.
            // The biggest drawback is its time complexity: O(n^2) in both worst and average cases,
            // which means the time it takes grows quickly as the list gets bigger.
            // For example, if you double the number of elements, the number of comparisons quadruples in the worst case.
            // Because of this, bubble sort is much slower than more efficient algorithms like merge sort (O(n log n)) or quicksort (O(n log n)) when working with large data sets.
            // Therefore, bubble sort is mostly used only for small lists or as a teaching exercise. It is perfect for understanding basic sorting principles.
            // But for larger lists, it is better to use more efficient algorithms like merge sort or quicksort since they are much faster and more efficient.
